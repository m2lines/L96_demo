    "The physical equations of motion of the system describing the atmosphere dynamics are known. Also in the real atmosphere there is variability over all scales, from the smallest molecular scales to the largest planetary scales.\n",
    "Thus, it is not feasible to explicitly solve the known physical equations of motion within Global Climate Models (GCMs), as computational resources limit the range of scales that can be resolved. To make the behavior of the GCM better match the real world, we need to effectively parameterize the effects that the unresolved scales have on the resolved (large) scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two time-scale L96 model, described in the the [previous notebook](https://m2lines.github.io/L96_demo/notebooks/L96-two-scale-description.html#), can be considered as a simplified analog for real world atmosphere, where variability resides at only two discrete scales (a simplification of the continuum in the real world). In this analogy, a GCM would be a model that can only solve the equations for the slow time scale, where the effects of the fast time-scale variables would be missing. We introduce the single time-scale version of the L96 model below. To make the single time scale model match the two time scale model, the effects of the fast time scales need to parameterized into the single time scale model."

    "In this chapter:\n",
    "- We argued that the single time-scale L96 model is a reduced representation of the two time-scale L96 model, which can be considered analogous to the way GCMs are a reduced repseration of the real world. \n",
    "- We showed that missing effects need to be parameterized, if the reduced representation is required behave like the full model/real world.\n",
    "- We used the two time-scale L96 model to generate a \"truth\" dataset for the effects of unresolved scales. \n",
    "- We built a \"GCM\" with a polynomial parameterization of coupling to unresolved processes ($\\left( \\frac{hc}{b} \\right) \\sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{j,k}$)\n",
    "- Finally we compared the solution from the two time-scale, single time-scale and parameterized single time-scale models, showing that the paramaterized version evolves more similarly to the two time-scale model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter we will further explore some key properties of parameterizations, and also discuss the other sources of error that can lead to a difference between the reduced and full models (or GCMs and real world)."
