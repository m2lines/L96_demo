    "In 1996, Lorenz proposed a two-time scale dynamical system, referred to as the Lorenz-96 model (L96), whose behavior mimics the non-linear dynamics of the extratropical atmosphere with simplified representation of multiscale interactions and nonlinear advection [Lorenz (1996)](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/10829-predictability-problem-partly-solved). The L96 model consists of two sets of equations coupling two sets of variables ($X_k$ and $Y_j,k$), which evolve over two (slow and fast) timescales and are arranged around a latitude circle as shown in Fig. 1. The equations comprising L96 are:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dt} X_k\n",
    "&= - X_{k-1} \\left( X_{k-2} - X_{k+1} \\right) - X_k + F - \\left( \\frac{hc}{b} \\right) \\sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{j,k},\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dt} Y_{j,k}\n",
    "&= - cbY_{j+1,k} \\left( Y_{j+2,k} - Y_{j-1,k} \\right) - c Y_{j,k} + \\frac{hc}{b} X_k\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X_k$, $k=1,\\ldots,K$, denotes $K$ slow (or low-frequency) variables and $Y_{j,k}$ , $j=1,\\ldots,J$ denotes $J*K$ fast (or high-frequency) variables. Each slow $X_k$ is coupled with $J$ fast $Y_{j,k}$ variables. The slow equations are coupled to the fast equations via a coupling term, $\\sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{j,k}$, which sums over the $J$ fast variables corresponding to a particular $k$. On the other hand, each fast equation is forced by the a coupling term, \\frac{hc}{b} X_k, that depends on the slow variable corresponding that particular $k$. The coupling and the fast time-scale equations depends on three key parameters: $b$, $c$ and $h$. Here $b$ determines the magnitude of the nonlinear interactions among the fast variables, $c$ controls how rapidly the fast variables fluctuate compared to the slow variables and, and $h$ governs the strength of the coupling between the slow and fast variables. Also, the slow time-scale equation is forced by $F$, e.g. [Wilks (2005)](http://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1256/qj.04.03).\n",

    "The chaotic dynamical system L96 is very useful for testing different numerical methods in atmospheric modeling thanks to its transparency, low computational cost and simplicity compared to Global Climate Models (GCM). The interaction between variables of different scales makes the L96 model of particular interest when evaluating new parameterization methodologies. As such, it was used in assessing different techniques that were later incorporated into GCMs ([Crommelin (2008)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/65/8/2008jas2566.1.xml), [Dorrestijn (2013)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2012.0374)).\n",

In the `L96_model` module, we provide the function `integrate_L96_2t` (shown next) that uses fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration. Starting from the initial conditions `X0,Y0`, the function returns the trajectories of `X,Y` sampled at an interval `si`.

The initial condition is setup as $X(s)=s(s-1)(s+1)$, for $s=-1\\ldots 1$, $Y=0$ and the value of $F=10$ is sufficient to obtain chaotic behavior here.
