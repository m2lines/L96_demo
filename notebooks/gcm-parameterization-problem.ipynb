    "Under the perturbations considered above, the lack of missing physics contributes the most error to the GCM.  \n",
    "This can be fixed by adding parameterizations, which have different contributions to error at different times. Specifically, the error grows more rapidly for the higher order parameterization relative to the linear parameterization, but saturates to smaller error at longer time. This might partly be because we optimized the parameters for the linear parameterization, but used parameter estimates for the higher order parameterization from the literature.  \n",
    "The second largest error source is the numerical approximation (or changed dt), suggesting that we need to be careful about the design and choice of the numerical schemes.\n",
    "The errors due to the forcing and initial condition reult in smaller errors, but will likely grow as the perturbations to these change. \n"

    "In this chapter:\n",
    "- We first reintroduced the GCM parameterization problem, discussing it in terms of limited observability of GCMs. \n",
    "- Then we discussed the need for stochastic parameterizations, which arises because of the possible differences in the unresolved or hidden states.\n",
    "- Then we discussed how skill can be measured, and defined four different metrics. \n",
    "- Finally we discussed the different sources of error that may be presend in numerical GCMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has made it clear that even models with some degree of tuning will diverge from the true solution, as there are multiple sources of errors. In the next chapter we discuss if and how GCMs and their parameterizations can be further tuned to enhance their range of predictability (which is known to not be in finite)."
