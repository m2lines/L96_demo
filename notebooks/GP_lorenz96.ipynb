    "The analytical solution in the above description relies on the assumption that the data are Gaussian distributed, which makes the maths straightfoward because the product of 2 Gaussians (the prior and likelihood) results in another Gaussian (the posterior). In the case where the data are not Gaussian distributed, the resultant posterior will no longer have a closed-form solution, so instead we need to approximate the posterior as a multivarite Gaussian (or other) using variational techniques. To do this, GPflow implements the approach outlined in [Opper and Archambeau, (2009)](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.archambeau/publ/neco_mo09_web.pdf), and we give a brief summary here to follow on from the section above.\n",

Therefore instead, we wish to approximate $p(\\textbf{f}_* | \\textbf{y})$ by a multivariate Gaussian $q(\\textbf{f}_*) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\textbf{m},\\textbf{S})$.

    "### Sparse GPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the need to invert the kernel matrix $\\textbf{K}$ (which has size $n \\times n$) in both the exact and variational settings, GP problems scale with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Therefore for data sets with more than a few thousand training points, the standard GP implementations above become problematic. A solution to this is to consider sparse GPs which rely on a set of *inducing variables* to learn the function $f$, as outlined in [Titsias, (2009)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/titsias09a/titsias09a.pdf). Note that GPflow has 2 commonly used classes for implementation of the inducing points method, namely 'SGPR' and 'SVGP'. Although at first it perhaps may seem that 'SVGP' is for variational inference and 'SGPR' is for exact inference, this is not actually the case. Sparse learning requires variational inference in either case, it is just that 'SVGP' is used for non-Gaussian data (as described above), while 'SGPR' is used for Gaussian data. Let's introduce the inducing points method now:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the set of points $\\textbf{z} = \\{z_1,z_2,...,z_m\\}$ where $m << n$, which could perhaps correspond to a subset of the training inputs, or a hold-out set etc, however the important point is that they exist in the same space as the inputs. These points are known as the *inducing points*, and subsequently their corresponding latent function values $\\textbf{u} = \\{f(z_1),f(z_2),...,f(z_m)\\}$ are known as the *inducing variables*. If we then assume that the posterior predictive function values at the input locations $\\textbf{x}$ and $\\textbf{x}_*$ (given by $\\textbf{f}$ and $\\textbf{f}_*$ respectively) are conditionally independent given $\\textbf{u}$, we can describe the posterior $p(\\textbf{f}_* | \\textbf{y})$ as a function of $\\textbf{u}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p(\\textbf{f}_* | \\textbf{y}) = \\int p(\\textbf{f}_* | \\textbf{u})p(\\textbf{u} | \\textbf{y}) \\ \\ d\\textbf{u}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can subsequently derive an analytical solution for $p(\\textbf{f}_* | \\textbf{u})$ above by recalling in the first section on exact inference how $\\textbf{y}$ and $\\textbf{f}_*$ formed a joint Gaussian under the GP prior. The same principles apply here to $\\textbf{u}$ and $\\textbf{f}_*$, hence the mean and covariance of $p(\\textbf{f}_* | \\textbf{u})$ follows the same form as those defined by $\\bar{\\textbf{f}}_*$ and $\\sigma_{\\textbf{f}_*}$ previously, except this time we replace all occurrences of $\\textbf{x}$ with $\\textbf{z}$, as well as re-defining the covariance matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\textbf{K} = k(\\textbf{z},\\textbf{z}) \\\\\n",
    "\\textbf{k}_* = k(\\textbf{z},\\textbf{x}_*) \\\\\n",
    "\\pmb{k}_* = k(\\textbf{z},\\textbf{z}).\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The second distribution above, $p(\\textbf{u} | \\textbf{y})$, does not have a closed-form solution however, so we need to rely on variational inference to approximate it as a multivariate Gaussian $q(\\textbf{u}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\textbf{m},\\textbf{S})$. Similar to what we saw in the variational inference discussion above, both $\\textbf{m}$ and $\\textbf{S}$ (as well as $\\textbf{z}$) can be optimised by minimising the variational free energy cost function $\\mathcal{J}\\big(q(\\textbf{f}_*)\\big)$. After which, we can produce an analytical solution for the approximate posterior mean and covariance as we have already seen, by once again replacing all occurrences of $\\textbf{x}$ with $\\textbf{z}$, as well as re-defining the covariance matrices. This results in much cheaper inference than before as the covariance matrix $\\textbf{K}$ is now of size $m \\times m$, hence the computational cost of the matrix inverse is now $\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ as opposed to $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. \n",

We then want to model for any potential correlation between the outputs $\\textbf{y}_k$, and hence the various functions $f_k(\\textbf{x}_k)$. One way to achieve this is through a concept known as *Linear models for coregionalisation* (see e.g., [Álvarez et al, 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.6251.pdf)), where we assume that the function $f(\\textbf{x})$ is drawn from the linear combination of some latent function $g(\\textbf{x})$, such that:\n",

The principle is that the outputs of $g(\\textbf{x})$ are uncorrelated, but through combining them with $\\textbf{W}$, they become correlated. In GPflow, the only possibility for incorporating the unique input-output task pairing is via a simpler approach known as the *Intrinsic model for Coregionalisation* (see the [docs](https://gpflow.github.io/GPflow/2.4.0/notebooks/advanced/coregionalisation.html)). In this approach we assume the covariance of the latent function values between two tasks is given by a linear combination of the input kernel:\n",
