    "- Some notion of individual \"fitness\" (in our case, how well they model the data, as well as their simplicity)\n",

    "Specific mutations aside, programs can have a limited lifespan, and those with high \"fitness\" produce more \"offspring\" (possibly-mutated versions of themselves). However, everything is probabilistic, so programs with lower fitness can still persist. This is critically important, because it allows genetic programming to overcome local minima during optimization.\n",

    "A common way to make linear regression return more sparse solutions is to minimize a linear combination of the mean squared error and the sum of the magnitudes of the weights. This is called applying an \"L1 penalty\" since it is the L1-norm of the weight vector, and is also referred to as the \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\", or LASSO. From a Bayesian perspective, this corresponds to doing Bayesian linear regression with a Laplace or double-exponential prior on the weights.\n",
