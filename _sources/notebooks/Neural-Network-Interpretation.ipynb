    "In this notebook we introduced some approaches that can be used to better understand how neural networks estimate the output from a given input. This is an important area of research, as we would want to test that the neural networks are producing the right answers for the right reasons (physically reasonable models). This becomes particularly important when we want our networks to produce accurate results (extrapolate) for inputs that were not observed in training data. \n",
