    "In 1996, Lorenz proposed a two-time scale dynamical system, referred to as the Lorenz-96 model (L96), whose behavior mimics the non-linear dynamics of the extratropical atmosphere with simplified representation of multiscale interactions and nonlinear advection {cite:p}`Lorenz1995`. The L96 model consists of two sets of equations coupling two sets of variables ($X_k$ and $Y_{j,k}$), which evolve over two (slow and fast) timescales and are arranged around a latitude circle as shown in Fig. 1. The equations comprising L96 are:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dt} X_k\n",
    "&= - X_{k-1} \\left( X_{k-2} - X_{k+1} \\right) - X_k + F - \\left( \\frac{hc}{b} \\right) \\sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{j,k},\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dt} Y_{j,k}\n",
    "&= - cbY_{j+1,k} \\left( Y_{j+2,k} - Y_{j-1,k} \\right) - c Y_{j,k} + \\frac{hc}{b} X_k\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X_k$, $k=1,\\ldots,K$, denotes $K$ slow (or low-frequency) variables, and $Y_{j,k}$ , $j=1,\\ldots,J$ denotes $J*K$ fast (or high-frequency) variables. \n",
    "The slow equations are coupled to the fast equations via a coupling term, $\\sum_{j=0}^{J-1} Y_{j,k}$, which sums over the $J$ fast variables corresponding to a particular $k$. On the other hand, each fast equation is forced by a coupling term, $\\frac{hc}{b} X_k$, that depends on the slow variable corresponding to that particular $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of this two-time scale system depend on three key parameters: $b$, $c$ and $h$. Here $b$ determines the magnitude of the nonlinear interactions among the fast variables, $c$ controls how rapidly the fast variables fluctuate compared to the slow variables and, $h$ governs the strength of the coupling between the slow and fast variables. Moreover, the slow time-scale equation is forced by the parameter $F$, whose value determines the chaotic behaviour of the system. E.g. {cite:p}`Wilks2005`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chaotic dynamical system L96 is very useful for testing different numerical methods in atmospheric modeling thanks to its transparency, low computational cost and simplicity compared to Global Climate Models (GCM). The interaction between variables of different scales makes the L96 model of particular interest when evaluating new parameterization methodologies. As such, it was used in assessing different techniques that were later incorporated into GCMs ({cite}`Crommelin2008`, {cite}`Dorrestijn2013`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The L96 model has been extensively used as a test bed in various studies including data assimilation approaches ({cite}`Law2016`, {cite}`Hatfield2017`), stochastic parameterization schemes ({cite}`Kwasniok2012`, {cite}`Arnold2013`, {cite}`Chorin2015`)  and Machine Learning-based parameterization methodologies ({cite}`Schneider2017`, {cite}`Dueben2018` , {cite}`Gagne2020`).\n",
