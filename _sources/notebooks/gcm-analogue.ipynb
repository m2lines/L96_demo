    "The physical equations of motion of the system describing the atmosphere dynamics are known. Also in the real atmosphere there is variability over all scales, from the smallest molecular scales to the largest planetary scales.\n",
    "Thus, it is not feasible to explicitly solve the known physical equations of motion within Global Climate Models (GCMs), as computational resources limit the range of scales that can be resolved. To make the behavior of the GCM better match the real world, we need to effectively parameterize the effects that the unresolved scales have on the resolved (large) scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two time-scale L96 model, described in the the [previous notebook](https://m2lines.github.io/L96_demo/notebooks/L96-two-scale-description.html#), can be considered as a simplified analog for real world atmosphere, where variability resides at only two discrete scales (a simplification of the continuum in the real world). In this analogy, a GCM would be a model that can only solve the equations for the slow time scale, where the effects of the fast time-scale variables would be missing. We introduce the single time-scale version of the L96 model below. To make the single time scale model match the two time scale model, the effects of the fast time scales need to parameterized into the single time scale model."
