    "Machine learning can be defined as : \"Machine learning is a way for computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.\" This definition was generated with the help of an AI agent called [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/4cb73dc4-e372-445c-8aca-94c6199540eb).  \n",

    "It has proven to be a useful tool to the scientific community by being able to make advancements in a range of problems, which had traditionally been very challenging or impossible. In our project, [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/), we are improving simulations of the climate system by targeting the parameterization or sub-grid closure problem with the help of ML. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, ML for our context can be thought of as a sophisticated way to approximate or estimate function. This can be done in a way where the structure of the functions is prescribed and constrained to very limited space of functions (e.g. linear regression) or in a way where the the structure of the function is left relatively free (e.g. neural networks). Regardless of this choice, all ML tasks can be broken down into a few general pieces:\n",
    "- Data : All ML tasks need data to learn patterns.\n",
    "- Model : Some choice needs to be made about the model architecture (e.g. neural network, gaussian process, etc). \n",
    "- Loss functions : The way a ML model gets closer to the true function is by minimizing some appropriately chosen loss function, a measure of error between truth and ML prediction.\n",
    "- Optimizers : To minize the error or loss function some method is needed to estimate optimal parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since all this is being done on a computer, some software architecture is needed. Possible, one of the major reasons for large scale adoption of machine learning has been the availability of easy to use, well documented, open source and general purpose machine learning libraries. Many such library exist, e.g. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), etc. In this book we will primarily use PyTorch. \n"
