    "- [AI Feynman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10782) (hybrid Python-Fortran implementation [here](https://github.com/SJ001/AI-Feynman)) starts by training a neural network, then computes _input gradients_ of the learned network, and then uses attributes of those gradients to decompose the symbolic regression problem into something more tractable using graph theory.\n",
